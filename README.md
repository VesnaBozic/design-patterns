# Design patterns in Python


## Definition

The design pattern is a technique which used by the developer to solve the commonly occurring software design. In simple word, it is a predefine pattern to solve a recurring problem in the code. These patterns are mainly designed based on requirements analysis.

The design pattern is a part of the software development. It is a general repeatable solution for the potential problem in software development. We can follow the patterns details and apply a solution which suits our code.

We may often confuse the patterns and algorithm, but both are separate approaches to solve repetitive problems. Algorithms generally define the clear set of the solution that can be implemented in some problems, where the patters are high-level description of the solution.

For example - An algorithm is like a cooking recipe: we have a clear set of ingredients (or set of solutions) to cook something (problems or goals). On the other side, a pattern is like a blueprint: we can see what the result and its features are, but we can modify the order of implementation.

All design pattern containt the following elements

• Pattern name

• Intent/purpose

• Aliases

• Motivation/context

• Problem

• Solution

• Structure

• Participants

• Collaborations

• Consequences/constraints

• Implementation

• Sample code

• Known uses

• Related patterns

## Why use design patterns?

Because they offer us tried and tested solution for the specific problems. It give us record of execution to decrease any technical risk to the projects. We can use them easily and flexible.

Design patterns have the predefined set of tried and tested solutions to a common problem encountered while developing software. If we know about the design pattern, then we can apply the solution without wasting time. It also teaches us how to solve the problem using the principle of object-oriented design.

Design pattern also enhances the common understanding between the developer and their teammates. 

Design patterns are also useful for the learning purpose because they introduce the common problem that we may have ignored. They also allow thinking that area that may not have had the hand-on experience.


## Clasification

 #### CREATIONAL
 
 Deals with the elements in the system - how they are created. 

#### STRUCTURAL

The structural patterns deal with how classes and objects are composed. Objects can be
composed using inheritance to obtain new functionality

#### BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS

These design patterns are focused on the interaction between objects

## The Singleton Pattern
